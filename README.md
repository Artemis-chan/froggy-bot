# Froggy bot
An open source bot written by the Frostbitten discord server! Discord: https://discord.gg/wth4ZCes

## Building/running
The only requirement is that you have `dotnet 5` installed.
After you have installed `dotnet 5`, all you have to do is cd into the FroggyBot directory, and run `dotnet run`.
Make sure you have your token in a file called `token.txt` in the FroggyBot directory!
